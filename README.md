# Bitpacker

A file compression program using huffman coding.

CLI use
BitPacker -c [Input_file] [output_file]     Compress
BitPacker -d [input_file] [output_file]     Decompress

## Description
This project was created as a final project for Advanced Data Structures (CSC-310). The goal of the assignment was simply to create something which demonstrated what you had learned in the class. The idea of writing a compression algorithm had been rattling around in my brain for a while before this so this seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally implement it. 

## What I learned
* How to efficiently grow a custom variable length data structure. See the Bitfield class.
* I became much more familiar with bitwise operations.
